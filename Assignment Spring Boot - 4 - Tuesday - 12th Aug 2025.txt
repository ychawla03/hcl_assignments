1.
FizzException
2.
BuzzException
3.
FizzBuzzException
Below is the endpoint for the
GET
API with a single path parameter:
GET /controller_advice/{code}
Exceptions are to be thrown based on the value of the path param {code} passed to the REST API.
Here is a series of requests and their corresponding expected responses:
GET
request to
/controller_advice/fizz
:
Should trigger the
FizzException
Should return the response code 500 and the
GlobalError
as the response body
GET
request to
/controller_advice/buzz
:
Should trigger the
BuzzException
Should return the response code 400 and the
GlobalError
as the response body
GET
request to
/controller_advice/fizzbuzz
:
Should trigger the
FizzBuzzException
Should return the response code 507 and the
GlobalError
as the response body
GET
request to
/controller_advice/success
:
Should not trigger any exceptions
Should return the response code 200 and the
FizzBuzzResponse
as the response body
Complete the project so that it passes all the test cases when running the provided unit tests. To do so, implement a controller advice global exceptionhandler
FizzBuzzExceptionHandler
, intercept the runtime exceptions thrown from the
GET
API endpoint, and return a response entity wrapped in the
GlobalError
class.
The runtime exceptions and error response classes are already predefined in the project. Complete the implementation controller
GET
API endpoint and thecontroller advice classes.
Example requests and responses
GET
request to
/controller_advice/fizz
The response code is 500, and when converted to JSON, the response body is:
{ "message": "Fizz Exception has been thrown", "errorReason" : "Internal Server Error"}
GET
request to
/controller_advice/buzz
The response code is 400, and when converted to JSON, the response body is:
{ "message": "Buzz Exception has been thrown", "errorReason" : "Bad Request"}
